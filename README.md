I was *attracted* to artificial neural nets through their *association* with real neuronal nets. Hopfield networks always seemed so cool to me, and I've wanted to build out a Boltzmann machine for a while. Fortunately, [Artem Kirsanov](https://www.youtube.com/@ArtemKirsanov) recently starting uploading new videos on these topics, reigniting this flame of mine. This repo will contain my notes on these topics, heavily taken from his videos, and a browser demo of the different networks.
