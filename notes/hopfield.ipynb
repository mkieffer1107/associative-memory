    "A Hopfield network is a type of recurrent neural network that demonstrates [auto-associative memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoassociative_memory). Simply put, it is a network with symmetric connections that, when given a partial pattern as a seed, will iterate itself until some full pattern is recovered. In this way, it associates the full pattern with the hint that it received. \n",

    "  The patterns are labeled by $\\mu = 1, 2, \\ldots, p$, and the neurons in the network are labeled by $i = 1, 2, \\ldots, N$. Both the stored patterns $\\xi^\\mu_i$ and the test patterns $\\zeta_i$ can be taken to be either $0$ or $1$ on each site $i$.\n",
